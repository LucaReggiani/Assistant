# assistant

this project has the aim to create a simple and useful assistant for your system.

## Modules Required:

 - pyttsx3: text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline and is 
            compatible with both Python 2 and 3. An application invokes the pyttsx3.init() factory function to 
            get a reference to a pyttsx3. It is a very easy to use tool which converts the entered text into speech.
            [here](https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
            In order to install the library:
            
       pip install pyttsx3
            
 - SpeechRecognition: Library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs, online
                      and offline. More info [here](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/). 
                      In order to install the library:
 
       pip install SpeechRecognition
