## explaination of the project

when the program starts, it's requested to the user to speek. During this time, each word that the user say for 5 seconds is recorded.
After 5 seconds, the registration is saved into the 'microphone-results.wav' file. Then, the file is reopened and its content 
is listened by the Recognizer object. if the command is recognized, it is converted in a string and stored in a variable in the main.
if the command is not recognized, the program asks at the user to repeat again. 
When the command will be recognized, the program pass the string to the gTTS method, that will convert the text in 
audio format and will save it in another file. Finally, this file is reproduced by mpg123 software, that is 
explained [here](https://www.mpg123.de/).
